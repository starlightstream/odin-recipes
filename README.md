# odin-recipes

Current project is to demonstrate how to create a repository on GitHub and link it to one's local machine, as well as to show understanding of basic HTML knowledge acquired through The Odin Projects, Foundations Course. Through this project I will show my knowledge by creating a html file, inserting an image, create both unordered and order lists, create a file in a directory and make a new directory within a directory, as well as creating relative and absolute links. This will also show my understanding in using Git and how to work through the states from Modified, Staged and Commited.
